    Hi, I'm Jacob, an incredibly passionate iOS developer. As of August 2023, I had released my first, albeit simple,
    app on the App Store. Throughout development, I set out with the idea that I wanted to improve aspects of the
    user's lifestyle through a simple, yet easy-to-use user interface. Timings focused on clearly setting out your
    goals, with easily recognizable symbols that we have always had on iPhone.

    <h1>My Inspiration</h1>
    Who do I look up to, you may ask? The answer you would receive is Steve Jobs. The answer as to why? There's many. If
    I had to give you one, it would have to be how Steve came from what you could call a disadvantaged background.
    Despite that, he did what he loved, and sometimes what he didn't (That Calligraphy class in college). Despite the
    fact he didn't particularly enjoy that course, little did everyone know that Calligraphy skills would later form the
    screen savers of the Mac's we know and use today.
    It's not just Steve that I look up to; it's his inventions and his visions too. Specifically, Apple. Some people
    call me obsessed with Apple's hardware and software, which to be honest, I can't deny. So, knowing that, I thought.
    How can I put this so-called obsession to good use.
