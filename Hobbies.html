        Who do i look up to you may ask? The answer you would recieve, Steve Jobs. The answer as to why? Theres many. If i had to give you one. It would have to be how Steve came from what you could call a disadvantaged background. Despite that, He he did what he loved, and sometimes what he didn't (That Calligraphy class in college). Despite the fact he didnt particulary enjoy that course. Little did eveyone know that  Calligary skills would later form the screen savers of the Mac's we know and use today. 
                    Its not just Steve that i look up to. Its his inventions too. Specifically, Apple. Some people call me obseesed with Apple's hardware and software, Which to be honest, i cant deny. So, knowing that, i thought. How can i put this so called obsession to good use.
