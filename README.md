This is a repository to keep track of changes in my digital Portfolio College Project. Github was my chosen form of Source Control as i have had past experience. The Digital Portfolio as a final Project Shoud contain the following Pages and subpages. Being a Work in Development Project. These are of Course subject to change, alteration or complete Cancellation. Throughout the course of development i will be using the .README file to fully keep track of development, while liasing with college staff:

The Pages in this document, in no specific order are;

- Homepage.
- About Me Page.
- A page dedicated to my college Projects.
- A page with a form and buttons to links to my social Media.
- A page dedicated to my personal Projects.
- A page dedicated to trips that ive been on and unique experiences i have had.
- Work, employment and any work Experience ive completed... Centre VR, You are the monster project?
- A table showcasing the qualification i have or, those that i am currently working towards, updated as and when.

This whole portfolio is a way for me to showcase my skill and any projects I am working on. As intended, it allows employers to view my work on a website that may in the future be hosted on the world-wide web. Furthermore, It can also act as a hub for me to effectively document my life outside of work.

      Secondly, the contact me page, will not only have a form to contact me with, I am plannig on adding buttons which direct the user to both my Professional Social Media Pages, and personal Page though a distinctly Styled Page.


      For my Projects pages. I am hoping to be able to link my Personal Projects, such as Those on the App store... Or those currently on Testflight. This hopefully will increase those apps engagement.

      Animations are also an element of interest, suchas like those found in canva with a form of shadow effect and blooming at hover. This would require CSS
