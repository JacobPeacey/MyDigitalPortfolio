               Just like most people my age. We all had left school .we either got nagged by our parents to get a job, and gave in and got one. Or, on the other hand felt compelled to become employeed, whether tht be for the valuable life skills you gain, or let's be honest the Money. I like to think that i am part of the latter group of people. I felt compelled to get a job , as all my CV had was hobby app and Web developer. That did not sit right with me. I was hungry for more. It was in July 2023 that i put true thought to what i wanted to do other the next 18 months, considering my educational pathway and prospects, and my aforementioned CV. 
                    I noticed that my local Mcdonald's franchise werre hiring crew member's. So i went onto their carrers page and applied for their vacamcy. Took their numerous assesments, and then got invited to an interview. While i got no feedback from that interview, i felt like everything went well, Of course with it being my first job, and subsequently my first Job application, i was numerous. However, i found out later that day that i had passed the interview and that they would like to extend an offer of employment, which i gladly accepted.
